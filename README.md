# DNS Proxy

## what is The DNSProxy?
A DNS proxy, also known as a DNS forwarder or a DNS resolver, is an intermediary server that sits between client devices and DNS servers. Its primary function is to handle DNS queries and forward them to appropriate DNS servers for resolution.

When a client device sends a DNS query to a DNS proxy, the proxy examines the request and acts as a middleman between the client and the DNS server. The DNS proxy checks its cache to see if it already has the resolved IP address for the requested domain. If the information is available in its cache, the proxy can respond directly to the client without sending a query to an external DNS server. This caching mechanism helps to improve the response time and reduce the load on DNS servers.
